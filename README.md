# Group-Design-Project
For my MEng Computer Science group design project, I was allocated to a group of 4 and given the task of producing an electronic pressure switch controllable remotely via a smartphone app. A pressure switch is a device that takes input from multiple pressure sensors, and performs control tasks based on the pressure values. I designed and implemented an Android app for controlling a pressure switch designed and built by my teammates. The customer requested that the application communicates with the pressure switch using Bluetooth and initiates the conneciton using NFC. That was really fun to implement!

## Design 
Going through 4 design iterations with the customer directly, I arrived at a design that the customer was pleased with. Below are screenshots of the final design of the implemented application.

### Experimental Features
I implemented some experemental features, like this live pressure reading from the sensors. Below are some screenshots of live readings!

## Demo 
Here are some gifs of the application in action!
