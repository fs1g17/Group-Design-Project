App I designed and implemented for controlling the settings of an electronic pressure switch. 
The electronic pressure switch was created by other team members, and I made this app to interact with it.
Communication is initiated using an NFC chip that contains the Bluetooth name of the device, which then 
prompts the Android device to initiate a bi-direcitonal Bluetooth connection.
